1. What's the output?
```javascript
let c = { greeting: 'Hey!' };
let d;

d = c;
c.greeting = 'Hello';
console.log(d.greeting);
```
- A: `Hello`
- B: `Hey!`
- C: `undefined`
- D: `ReferenceError`
- E: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, all objects interact by _reference_ when setting them equal to each other.

First, variable `c` holds a value to an object. Later, we assign `d` with the same reference that `c` has to the object.

When you change one object, you change all of them.

2. What happens when we do this?
```javascript
function bark() {

}

bark.animal = 'dog';
```
- A: Nothing, this is totally fine!
- B: `SyntaxError`. You cannot add properties to a function this way.
- C: `"Woof"` gets logged.
- D: `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

This is possible in JavaScript, because functions are objects! (Everything besides primitive types are objects)

A function is a special type of object. The code you write yourself isn't the actual function. The function is an object with properties. This property is invocable.

const member = new Person('Lydia', 'Hallie');
Person.getFullName = function() {

```
- A: `TypeError`
- B: `SyntaxError`
- C: `Lydia Hallie`
- D: `undefined` `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

In JavaScript, functions are objects, and therefore, the method `getFullName` gets added to the constructor function object itself. For that reason, we can call `Person.getFullName()`, but `member.getFullName` throws a `TypeError`. 

If you want a method to be available to all object instances, you have to add it to the prototype property:

```js
Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
  return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
};
```

console.log(lydia);
console.log(sarah);
```
- A: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `undefined`
- B: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `Person {firstName: "Sarah", lastName: "Smith"}`
- C: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `{}`
- D: `Person {firstName: "Lydia", lastName: "Hallie"}` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

For `sarah`, we didn't use the `new` keyword. When using `new`, `this` refers to the new empty object we create. However, if you don't add `new`, `this` refers to the **global object**!

We said that `this.firstName` equals `"Sarah"` and `this.lastName` equals `"Smith"`. What we actually did, is defining `global.firstName = 'Sarah'` and `global.lastName = 'Smith'`. `sarah` itself is left `undefined`, since we don't return a value from the `Person` function.

    console.log(`Hmmm... You don't have an age I guess`);
  }
}

checkAge({ age: 18 });
```
- A: `You are an adult!`
- B: `You are still an adult.`
- C: `Hmm.. You don't have an age I guess`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

When testing equality, primitives are compared by their _value_, while objects are compared by their _reference_. JavaScript checks if the objects have a reference to the same location in memory.

The two objects that we are comparing don't have that: the object we passed as a parameter refers to a different location in memory than the object we used in order to check equality.

This is why both `{ age: 18 } === { age: 18 }` and `{ age: 18 } == { age: 18 }` return `false`.

#### Answer: A

`String` is a built-in constructor, which we can add properties to. I just added a method to its prototype. Primitive strings are automatically converted into a string object, generated by the string prototype function. So, all strings (string objects) have access to that method!

- A: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1997"`
- B: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1998"`
- C: `{ name: "Lydia" }, "1998"`
- D: `{ name: "Sarah" }, "1997"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Arguments are passed by _value_, unless their value is an object, then they're passed by _reference_. `birthYear` is passed by value, since it's a string, not an object. When we pass arguments by value, a _copy_ of that value is created (see question 46).

The variable `birthYear` has a reference to the value `"1997"`. The argument `year` also has a reference to the value `"1997"`, but it's not the same value as `birthYear` has a reference to. When we update the value of `year` by setting `year` equal to `"1998"`, we are only updating the value of `year`. `birthYear` is still equal to `"1997"`.

The value of `person` is an object. The argument `member` has a (copied) reference to the _same_ object. When we modify a property of the object `member` has a reference to, the value of `person` will also be modified, since they both have a reference to the same object. `person`'s `name` property is now equal to the value `"Lydia"`

- A: `It worked! Hello world!`
- B: `Oh no an error: undefined`
- C: `SyntaxError: can only throw Error objects`
- D: `Oh no an error: Hello world!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With the `throw` statement, we can create custom errors. With this statement, you can throw exceptions. An exception can be a <b>string</b>, a <b>number</b>, a <b>boolean</b> or an <b>object</b>. In this case, our exception is the string `'Hello world!'`.

With the `catch` statement, we can specify what to do if an exception is thrown in the `try` block. An exception is thrown: the string `'Hello world!'`. `e` is now equal to that string, which we log. This results in `'Oh an error: Hello world!'`.

```
- A: `"Lamborghini"`
- B: `"Maserati"`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `TypeError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

When you return a property, the value of the property is equal to the _returned_ value, not the value set in the constructor function. We return the string `"Maserati"`, so `myCar.make` is equal to `"Maserati"`.

- B: `"Lydia"`, `21`
- C: `true`, `true`
- D: `undefined`, `undefined`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The `delete` operator returns a boolean value: `true` on a successful deletion, else it'll return `false`. However, variables declared with the `var`, `const` or `let` keyword cannot be deleted using the `delete` operator.

The `name` variable was declared with a `const` keyword, so its deletion is not successful: `false` is returned. When we set `age` equal to `21`, we actually added a property called `age` to the global object. You can successfully delete properties from objects this way, also the global object, so `delete age` returns `true`.

- C: `{ admin: true, user: ["Lydia", 21] }`
- D: `{ admin: true }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

It's possible to combine objects using the spread operator `...`. It lets you create copies of the key/value pairs of one object, and add them to another object. In this case, we create copies of the `user` object, and add them to the `admin` object. The `admin` object now contains the copied key/value pairs, which results in `{ admin: true, name: "Lydia", age: 21 }`.

- B: `"{"username": "lydiahallie"}"`
- C: `"["level", "health"]"`
- D: `"{"username": "lydiahallie", "level":19, "health":90}"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The second argument of `JSON.stringify` is the _replacer_. The replacer can either be a function or an array, and lets you control what and how the values should be stringified.

If the replacer is an _array_, only the property names included in the array will be added to the JSON string. In this case, only the properties with the names `"level"` and `"health"` are included, `"username"` is excluded. `data` is now equal to `"{"level":19, "health":90}"`.

If the replacer is a _function_, this function gets called on every property in the object you're stringifying. The value returned from this function will be the value of the property when it's added to the JSON string. If the value is `undefined`, this property is excluded from the JSON string.

- C: `1` `undefined` and `2` `undefined` and `3` `undefined` and `4` `undefined`
- D: `1` `2` and `undefined` `3` and `undefined` `4`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

The first argument that the `reduce` method receives is the _accumulator_, `x` in this case. The second argument is the _current value_, `y`. With the reduce method, we execute a callback function on every element in the array, which could ultimately result in one single value.

In this example, we are not returning any values, we are simply logging the values of the accumulator and the current value.

The value of the accumulator is equal to the previously returned value of the callback function. If you don't pass the optional `initialValue` argument to the `reduce` method, the accumulator is equal to the first element on the first call.

On the first call, the accumulator (`x`) is `1`, and the current value (`y`) is `2`. We don't return from the callback function, we log the accumulator and current value: `1` and `2` get logged.

If you don't return a value from a function, it returns `undefined`. On the next call, the accumulator is `undefined`, and the current value is `3`. `undefined` and `3` get logged.

On the fourth call, we again don't return from the callback function. The accumulator is again `undefined`, and the current value is `4`. `undefined` and `4` get logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

With the `import` keyword, all imported modules are _pre-parsed_. This means that the imported modules get run _first_, the code in the file which imports the module gets executed _after_.

This is a difference between `require()` in CommonJS and `import`! With `require()`, you can load dependencies on demand while the code is being run. If we would have used `require` instead of `import`, `running index.js`, `running sum.js`, `3` would have been logged to the console.

- C: `Promise {<pending>}`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

An async function always returns a promise. The `await` still has to wait for the promise to resolve: a pending promise gets returned when we call `getData()` in order to set `data` equal to it.

If we wanted to get access to the resolved value `"I made it"`, we could have used the `.then()` method on `data`:

`data.then(res => console.log(res))`

This would've logged `"I made it!"`

- B: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Calculated! 20`
- C: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `From cache! 20`
- D: `Calculated! 20` `From cache! 20` `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `add` function is a _memoized_ function. With memoization, we can cache the results of a function in order to speed up its execution. In this case, we create a `cache` object that stores the previously returned values.

If we call the `addFunction` function again with the same argument, it first checks whether it has already gotten that value in its cache. If that's the case, the caches value will be returned, which saves on execution time. Else, if it's not cached, it will calculate the value and store it afterwards.

We call the `addFunction` function three times with the same value: on the first invocation, the value of the function when `num` is equal to `10` isn't cached yet. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `false`, and the else block gets executed: `Calculated! 20` gets logged, and the value of the result gets added to the cache object. `cache` now looks like `{ 10: 20 }`.

The second time, the `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

The third time, we pass `5 * 2` to the function which gets evaluated to `10`. The `cache` object contains the value that gets returned for `10`. The condition of the if-statement `num in cache` returns `true`, and `'From cache! 20'` gets logged.

- C: `{ name: "Lydia", age: 21, city: undefined }`
- D: `"Amsterdam"`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

We set the variable `city` equal to the value of the property called `city` on the `person` object. There is no property on this object called `city`, so the variable `city` has the value of `undefined`.

Note that we are _not_ referencing the `person` object itself! We simply set the variable `city` equal to the current value of the `city` property on the `person` object.

Then, we set `city` equal to the string `"Amsterdam"`. This doesn't change the person object: there is no reference to that object.

When logging the `person` object, the unmodified object gets returned.

#### Answer: A

With the `import * as name` syntax, we import _all exports_ from the `module.js` file into the `index.js` file as a new object called `data` is created. In the `module.js` file, there are two exports: the default export, and a named export. The default export is a function which returns the string `"Hello World"`, and the named export is a variable called `name` which has the value of the string `"Lydia"`.

The `data` object has a `default` property for the default export, other properties have the names of the named exports and their corresponding values.

#### Answer: A

`Object.entries(person)` returns an array of nested arrays, containing the keys and objects:

`[ [ 'name', 'Lydia' ], [ 'age', 21 ] ]`

Using the `for-of` loop, we can iterate over each element in the array, the subarrays in this case. We can destructure the subarrays instantly in the for-of loop, using `const [x, y]`. `x` is equal to the first element in the subarray, `y` is equal to the second element in the subarray.

The first subarray is `[ "name", "Lydia" ]`, with `x` equal to `"name"`, and `y` equal to `"Lydia"`, which get logged.
The second subarray is `[ "age", 21 ]`, with `x` equal to `"age"`, and `y` equal to `21`, which get logged.

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: B

In JavaScript, we don't _have_ to write the semicolon (`;`) explicitly, however the JavaScript engine still adds them after statements. This is called **Automatic Semicolon Insertion**. A statement can for example be variables, or keywords like `throw`, `return`, `break`, etc.

Here, we wrote a `return` statement, and another value `a + b` on a _new line_. However, since it's a new line, the engine doesn't know that it's actually the value that we wanted to return. Instead, it automatically added a semicolon after `return`. You could see this as:

```javascript
return;
a + b;
```

This means that `a + b` is never reached, since a function stops running after the `return` keyword. If no value gets returned, like here, the function returns `undefined`. Note that there is no automatic insertion after `if/else` statements!

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

With a promise, we basically say _I want to execute this function, but I'll put it aside for now while it's running since this might take a while. Only when a certain value is resolved (or rejected), and when the call stack is empty, I want to use this value._

We can get this value with both `.then` and the `await` keyword in an `async` function. Although we can get a promise's value with both `.then` and `await`, they work a bit differently.

In the `firstFunction`, we (sort of) put the myPromise function aside while it was running, but continued running the other code, which is `console.log('second')` in this case. Then, the function resolved with the string `I have resolved`, which then got logged after it saw that the callstack was empty.

With the await keyword in `secondFunction`, we literally pause the execution of an async function until the value has been resolved before moving to the next line.

This means that it waited for the `myPromise` to resolve with the value `I have resolved`, and only once that happened, we moved to the next line: `second` got logged.

We can pass any type of value we want to `Promise.resolve`, either a promise or a non-promise. The method itself returns a promise with the resolved value (`<fulfilled>`). If you pass a regular function, it'll be a resolved promise with a regular value. If you pass a promise, it'll be a resolved promise with the resolved value of that passed promise.

In this case, we just passed the numerical value `5`. It returns a resolved promise with the value `5`.

27. What's the output?
```javascript
function compareMembers(person1, person2 = person) {
  if (person1 !== person2) {
    console.log('Not the same!');
  } else {
    console.log('They are the same!');
  }
}

const person = { name: 'Lydia' };

compareMembers(person);
```
- A: `Not the same!`
- B: `They are the same!`
- C: `ReferenceError`
- D: `SyntaxError`

#### Answer: B

Objects are passed by reference. When we check objects for strict equality (`===`), we're comparing their references.

We set the default value for `person2` equal to the `person` object, and passed the `person` object as the value for `person1`.

This means that both values have a reference to the same spot in memory, thus they are equal.

The code block in the `else` statement gets run, and `They are the same!` gets logged.

28. What's the output?
```javascript
let config = {
  alert: setInterval(() => {
    console.log('Alert!');
  }, 1000),
};

config = null;
```
- A: The `setInterval` callback won't be invoked
- B: The `setInterval` callback gets invoked once
- C: The `setInterval` callback will still be called every second
- D: We never invoked `config.alert()`, config is `null`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Normally when we set objects equal to `null`, those objects get _garbage collected_ as there is no reference anymore to that object. However, since the callback function within `setInterval` is an arrow function (thus bound to the `config` object), the callback function still holds a reference to the `config` object. 
As long as there is a reference, the object won't get garbage collected. 
Since this is an interval, setting `config` to `null` or `delete`-ing `config.alert` won't garbage-collect the interval, so the interval will still be called. 
It should be cleared with `clearInterval(config.alert)` to remove it from memory.
Since it was not cleared, the `setInterval` callback function will still get invoked every 1000ms (1s).

29. What's the output?
```javascript
const myPromise = Promise.resolve(Promise.resolve('Promise!'));

function funcOne() {
  myPromise.then(res => res).then(res => console.log(res));
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout!'), 0);
  console.log('Last line!');
}

async function funcTwo() {
  const res = await myPromise;
  console.log(await res);
  setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout!'), 0);
  console.log('Last line!');
}

funcOne();
funcTwo();
```

- A: `Promise! Last line! Promise! Last line! Last line! Promise!`
- B: `Last line! Timeout! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Promise!`
- C: `Promise! Last line! Last line! Promise! Timeout! Timeout!`
- D: `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>

#### Answer: D

First, we invoke `funcOne`. On the first line of `funcOne`, we call the `myPromise` promise, which is an _asynchronous_ operation. While the engine is busy completing the promise, it keeps on running the function `funcOne`. The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API. (see my article on the event loop <a href="https://dev.to/lydiahallie/javascript-visualized-event-loop-3dif">here</a>.)

Both the promise and the timeout are asynchronous operations, the function keeps on running while it's busy completing the promise and handling the `setTimeout` callback. This means that `Last line!` gets logged first, since this is not an asynchonous operation. This is the last line of `funcOne`, the promise resolved, and `Promise!` gets logged. However, since we're invoking `funcTwo()`, the call stack isn't empty, and the callback of the `setTimeout` function cannot get added to the callstack yet.

In `funcTwo` we're, first _awaiting_ the myPromise promise. With the `await` keyword, we pause the execution of the function until the promise has resolved (or rejected). Then, we log the awaited value of `res` (since the promise itself returns a promise). This logs `Promise!`.

The next line is the _asynchronous_ `setTimeout` function, from which the callback is sent to the Web API.

We get to the last line of `funcTwo`, which logs `Last line!` to the console. Now, since `funcTwo` popped off the call stack, the call stack is empty. The callbacks waiting in the queue (`() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcOne`, and `() => console.log("Timeout!")` from `funcTwo`) get added to the call stack one by one. The first callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. Then, the second callback logs `Timeout!`, and gets popped off the stack. This logs `Last line! Promise! Promise! Last line! Timeout! Timeout!`

30. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?
```javascript
const person = { name: 'Lydia Hallie' };

Object.seal(person);
```
- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `person.age = 21`
- C: `delete person.name`
- D: `Object.assign(person, { age: 21 })`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

With `Object.seal` we can prevent new properies from being _added_, or existing properties to be _removed_.

However, you can still modify the value of existing properties.

31. Which of the following will modify the `person` object?
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Lydia Hallie',
  address: {
    street: '100 Main St',
  },
};

Object.freeze(person);
```
- A: `person.name = "Evan Bacon"`
- B: `delete person.address`
- C: `person.address.street = "101 Main St"`
- D: `person.pet = { name: "Mara" }`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

The `Object.freeze` method _freezes_ an object. No properties can be added, modified, or removed.

However, it only _shallowly_ freezes the object, meaning that only _direct_ properties on the object are frozen. If the property is another object, like `address` in this case, the properties on that object aren't frozen, and can be modified.
